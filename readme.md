### Setup dev and Git

- Clone this repo.
- Drag and drop the `.user.js` file to User Scripts panel in Firefox Addon page.
- Open the file location. You can locate it by try _Edit this Userscript_ feature.
- Remove the folder.
- Make symlink in that folder with the deleted folder name to this repo location (we can do that even on Windows).
